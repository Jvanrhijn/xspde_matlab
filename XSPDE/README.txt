README


xSPDE2.1

The xSPDE folder should contain the xSIM, xGRAPH and xAMPLES folder.

Set your Matlab path to include this folder and subfolders.

Run xAMPLES/Batchtest.m to test operation.

XSPDE runs best combined with the Matlab parallel toolbox.

If you have no parallel toolbox, set ensembles(3) = 1 in the examples.

Happy xspde-ing.
