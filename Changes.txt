Changes that are included in xSPDE1.1

This is a major redesign of the graphics code, to allow more flexibility in slicing, plotting and replotting multidimensional data.

(1) For stand-alone use, xgraph is in a separate folder and subdivided into distinct function files.

(2) Graphs can be made of functions, `in.functions{n}', whose default value is the n-th average obtained from the simulation data. In general, any function of averages is permitted. There is a another function 'in.xfunctions{n}{nd}' allowing any axis transformation. A combined cell array of axis labels for each graph,'in.glabels{n}{nd}' allows any graphed function to have any axis label. For backward compatibility, the global labels 'in.xlabels{nd}', 'in.klabels{nd}' are allowed.

(3) An input ‘in.axes{n}{k}’ is available for each graphics function. For each graph function {n}, this has d components, one for each axis. If axes{n}{k}= 0, all of axis k is plotted. If axes{n}{k} = -1, gives the middle point for space axes or the last point for the time axis. If axes{n}{k} = a:b, plots the range of a:b, while if axes{n}{k} = a:b:c uses steps of b, for the k-th axis.

(4) Order of inputs to xgraph is reversed with data first. A new input, in.averages, gives the largest number of averages that will be returned. 

(5) Improvements are made to xgraph so that any new parameter inputs over-ride previous file inputs of graphics parameters. The previous inputs are in turn preferred over the graphics default values. 

(6) Average data is now stored in a nested cell array of form data{seq}{graph}(error,np,nspace)
