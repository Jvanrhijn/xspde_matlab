Changes that are included in xSPDE1.2

This is a bug-fix release, which also includes a more consistent, unified model of data structures. All data has either explicit or implicit order of component, errors, dimension, including raw data and graphed averages. Different components are lines for graphing. Derivative arrays now have the same notation as coordinates, r.Dx or r.D{1}. 

Note that arbitrary functions of averaged variables can be taken either during simulation, or else while graphing data. The first option has the advantage that accurate error bars are obtained.
